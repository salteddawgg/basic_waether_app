Hello! Welcome to my attempt at a weather app! Please use and steal till your heart's content.

This project comes from the Odin project.

All searches should follow the form "City, State/Country"

This app uses basic JavaScript code and the free API from weathermap.com, the documentation was easy to read and the API works great.
I highly recommend them for any future weather data calling needs.

This was made for my advanced web programming class, so please don't judge me mentally. However, critiques and recommendations are more than welcome!

I am aware that the API key is public, for this project, I was told that it's fine by the odin project. So I guess I'm just going to leave it public for now.

I currently have no plans for this project, though I did enjoy re-learning to use APIs. I will probably use this project to add a bit of flare to future, bigger projects.
